Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Queries against the .arpa nameservers\r\n  The draft should mention that .arpa is a delegated zone, currently served by the root nameservers. Clients that query a resolver that is unaware of this requirement will \"leak\" queries to the root nameservers.\r\n- When _dns.resolver.arpa/SVCB is not present in a resolver configuration\r\n  Section 6.1 discusses how a forwarder should behave and suggests that results should not be cached other than for Equivalent Encrypted Resolvers under their control. How is that determined?\r\n  There is no discussion around a non-forwarding resolver's behaviour. Should it return NODATA?\r\n  Forwarding queries to _dns.resolver.arpa/SVCB will attempt to attach a client to an upstream resource's equivalent resolver. If that equivalent resolver's cert doesn't include the forwarder, the client must reject the answer. Is it not therefore the case that the forwarder caching behaviour is irrelevant? All valid responses to this query must be equivalent to the forwarder itself.\r\n- When _dns.resolver.arpa/SVCB is present in a resolver configuration\r\n  I would suggest some clarification wording something like this: The expectation is that this record set will detail equivalent resolvers. A client that chooses not to interact with any of these equivalent resolvers SHOULD continue to use the unencrypted resolver, honouring the SVCB TTL. When the SVCB TTL expires, the client may choose to re-query in an attempt to discover newly available equivalents.\r\n\r\nI would suggest (prefer?) changing the SUDN behaviour so that queries against it are never sent upstream. Resolvers (and forwarders) that do not have a configured _dns.resolver.arpa/SVCB RRset should return NODATA. This would mean that resolver.arpa SUDN RRsets are always specific to the IP queried.",

Could you clarify please.",

This is particularly important or useful for DoH, where the URI path and HTTP authority would not otherwise be known. The client could guess, but it may not be able to form a valid HTTP request.\r\n\r\nThe DoT ports, etc, could also be different, but that's often less useful.",
